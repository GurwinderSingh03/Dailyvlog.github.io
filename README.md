# DAY 1 
"On 10th July, it was my first day at GNE College. Our inaugural day started with Kirtan and Ardass in the college's Gurdwara Sahib. After the Ardass, the college organized a tea break for almost half an hour. Following this, the inaugural day continued in the college auditorium. Speeches were delivered by our college principal, H.O.D. (Head of Department), and the guests of honour."

I made a few adjustments for clarity and correctness. Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else you'd like me to help with!

# DAY 2

COMMING SOON....
